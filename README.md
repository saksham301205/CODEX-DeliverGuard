## 1. Problem & Persona

### 🚨 Problem

Delivery workers face **income loss due to external disruptions** such as:

- 🌧 Heavy Rain  
- 🌫 High Pollution (AQI)  
- 🌡 Heatwaves  
- 🚫 Curfews / Zone Restrictions  

These events reduce working hours, yet **no real-time insurance solution exists**.

---

### 👤 Persona

**Name:** Ravi  
**Role:** Food Delivery Partner  
**Location:** Chennai  

**Scenario:**
- Daily earnings: ₹800–₹1000  
- Rain/AQI → fewer orders  
- Curfews → blocked routes  

Result: **Unprotected income loss**

## 2. Premium Model & Parametric Triggers

### Risk-Based Weekly Premium

```python
# Risk Score Calculation
Risk_Score = (
    0.3 * Rain_Risk +
    0.2 * AQI_Risk +
    0.2 * Heat_Risk +
    0.2 * Flood_Risk +
    0.1 * Social_Risk
)

Premium = 30 + (Risk_Score * 50)
```

| Risk Level | Premium |
|-----------|--------|
| 🟢 Low | ₹40/week |
| 🟡 Medium | ₹55/week |
| 🔴 High | ₹70/week |

---

### Parametric Triggers

| Trigger | Condition |
|--------|----------|
| 🌧 Rainfall | > 80 mm |
| 🌫 AQI | > 300 |
| 🌡 Temperature | > 40°C |
| 🌊 Flood Alert | Active |
| 🚫 Curfew | Zone restricted |

> **Key Insight:** Claims are triggered automatically — no manual filing required.

---

## 3. AI/ML Integration

### Risk Prediction

- Predicts disruption probability per zone  
- Inputs:
  - Weather data  
  - AQI  
  - Historical trends  
- Model: **Linear Regression**

---

### Fraud Detection

**Model:** Isolation Forest  

Detects:

- 📍 GPS spoofing  
- ❌ Claims from unaffected zones  
- 🔁 Duplicate claims  
- 🌤 Weather mismatch  

> Example: Rain claim + no rainfall → **rejected**
